Created By: Ishan Leung, 2024

Language: Python 3 with Tensorflow

# How to Use
Instructions:

(1) Drag keras_model.h5, labels.txt, and testing data (image files, 100 max) to files tab. Note: Drag files directly and DO NOT put the files into a subfolder and drag that subfolder over. Ensure the First File is named image(1).jpg and the Last File is named image(max).jpg Note: Replace 'max' with the highest file number.

(2) Click Runtime --> Run All

(3) Enter Number of Files

(4) Select Tumor Type to Test For

(5) Interpret Results
